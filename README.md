Portfolio website
This website was created as a part of the Web Design for Everybody Capstone course requirement on Coursera. The project was supposed to built either from scratch, a template or a framework. I chose to build mine from a template I found on bootstrapmade(https://bootstrapmade.com/) and edited to my preference.
